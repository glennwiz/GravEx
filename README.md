# Particle System with Gravity in GoDot

## Overview
Create a particle system in Go where particles are affected by a gravity simulation.

## Steps

### 1. Initialize the Particle System
- Define a `Particle` struct with attributes:
  - Position (x, y)
  - Velocity (vx, vy)
  - Color, Size, etc.
  
### 2. Gravity Logic
- Define a gravity constant (e.g., `9.81` for Earth-like gravity)
- For each game loop iteration, adjust each particle's velocity based on the gravity constant.

### 3. Render Particles
- For each game loop iteration, update each particle's position based on its velocity.
- Draw each particle on the screen at its updated position.

### 4. User Interactions (optional)
- Allow users to spawn particles with a mouse click or key press.
- Allow users to adjust gravity intensity in real-time.

### 5. Optimization
- Implement a quadtree or another spatial partitioning method to efficiently handle large numbers of particles.
- Consider adding a max particle limit or an aging system where old particles fade away.

### 6. Testing & Debugging
- Test the simulation with varying numbers of particles.
- Check the performance and make any necessary optimizations.

## Conclusion
Onc we have completed these steps, we will have a basic particle system with gravity in Godot. From here, you can expand on the simulation by adding more forces, behaviors, or visual effects!
